# nRF51BlueToothDemo
A demo based on the Android BLE sample code, originally written for the nRF51 dongle by [Travis Fagerness](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/author/travis-fagerness) on [All About Circuits](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/how-to-communicate-with-a-custom-ble-using-an-android-app/).

Modified by me for the [SH-M08](http://www.dsdtech-global.com/2017/07/dsd-tech-sh-m08-cc2541-bluetooth-40-ble.html) and [SH-HC-08](http://www.dsdtech-global.com/search/label/SH-HC-08%20Bluetooth%204.0%20BLE%20Slave%20Module) modules.
